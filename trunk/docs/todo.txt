Stuff I have in mind that I might implement in future releases (no specific order).

+ Change PostUpdate Event to work on original canvas instead of output canvas
+ Maybe extend BROWSER ENGINE property for mobiles
+ Hide mouse pointer while over canvas: http://pc.autons.net/stuff/blanks/ http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2636068/hide-cursor-in-chrome-and-ie

Known Bugs

+ Toggle Fullscreen does not work in all examples under Opera
+ Touch events on mobile (e.g. MouseX/MouseY) are not supported properly
